# AI Meets SDLC

Website for the AI meets SDLC seminar, held 13 October 2026 at Marsio Saastamoinen Foundation Stage, Espoo, Finland.

The site is built with Gustwind and HTMLisp, styled with Tailwind CSS, and
deployed as a Cloudflare Worker with static assets. The production domain is
`sdlcai.org`.

## Requirements

- Node 24 or newer. The repository includes `.node-version` for Cloudflare
  Workers Builds and local version managers.
- npm
- Wrangler access to the Cloudflare account for Worker, D1, R2, and Turnstile
  setup.

## Project Structure

- `site/layouts/index.html`: main page markup and client-side behavior.
- `site/tailwind.css`: font faces, Tailwind theme variables, and global styles.
- `assets/`: logo, favicon, fonts, and referenced media.
- `worker/index.ts`: Cloudflare Worker, interest form endpoint, and scheduled
  backups.
- `migrations/`: D1 schema.
- `scripts/`: local helper scripts for dotenv, backup decryption, and build
  verification.
- `docs/cloudflare.md`: Cloudflare provisioning, secrets, backup, and deployment
  notes.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the Gustwind development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Build the static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

Serve the generated build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Format and validate:

```bash
npm run format
npm run format:check
npm run validate
```

## Worker Development

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set a local `EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, then generate
Wrangler's `.dev.vars`:

```bash
npm run dev:env
```

Apply the local D1 migration:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:local
```

Run the Worker locally:

```bash
npm run worker:dev
```

`worker:dev` builds the site, verifies that `build/index.html` exists, and then
starts Wrangler.

## Interest List

The interest form stores submissions in Cloudflare D1. Email, name, and
organization are encrypted before insert, and a keyed email hash is stored for
deduplication. Plaintext contact details are not stored in D1 or R2.

Scheduled backups export encrypted D1 rows to R2. A latest-backup manifest
stores a hash of the encrypted rows so unchanged scheduled runs do not write
duplicate backup objects.

Decrypt a downloaded backup with:

```bash
EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=... npm run interests:decrypt -- backup.json
```

Export contact details for follow-up email from production D1 with:

```bash
EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=... npm run --silent interests:export -- --remote > contacts.csv
```

The export script also supports local D1 and downloaded backups:

```bash
EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=... npm run --silent interests:export -- --local
EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=... npm run --silent interests:export -- --input backup.json
EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=... npm run --silent interests:export -- --remote --format json
```

## Deployment

Deploy through Cloudflare Workers Builds or locally with:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

See [Cloudflare setup](docs/cloudflare.md) for provisioning, secrets, backup, and
deployment notes.
